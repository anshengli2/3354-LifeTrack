test_plan Java project:
- displayDate
This method uses the compareTo() method to compare two dates. If the result is a 0, the dates are equal. If not, the dates
are not equal. 

- testDisplayDate
This file contains two test cases. The date we want to be displayed is 4/19/2020, so an object is created for this date. Another
object is created for 4/19/2020. Then the assertEquals test is used to check if these dates are the same. Since they are equal, 
the test passes. A third object is created for another date (12/3/2016), then the assertEquals test is used. This third object 
is commented out. Since the two objects are not equal, the test fails.


test_plan_activities Java project:
- Activity
The Activity object contains month, day, year, starting time of event (hour and minute), ending time of event (hour and minute),
category, and description. This class contains two constructors, a method that checks conflicts, and a toString method. 

- testComparingActivities
This file contains two test cases. The first case is two events that do not conflict, so the test passes. The second case is 
two conflicting events, so the test fails (this case is commented out).
